; ==============================================================================
; INITIAL STATE OF CONTAINERS
; ==============================================================================
; The bottle has wine in it, the jar is empty:
x bottle
x jar
; ==============================================================================
; THE 'FILL WITH' BUG!
; ==============================================================================
; Now we attempt to fill the jar with wine (it will fail by default):
fill jar with wine
; IMPLICIT TAKING REVEALS BUG:
pour wine
; NOTE: The wine has "magically" moved to the jar! This is due to a bug in how
;       'fill_with' is implemented on liquids --- i.e. it always sets the vessel
;       of 'substance' TO 'cont' (regardless if the action failed)!
