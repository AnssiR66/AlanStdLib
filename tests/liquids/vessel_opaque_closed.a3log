Welcome to the ALAN StdLib's "Liquids Test Laboratory," a private
research facility founded by Anssi Räisänen with funds from the
"International ALAN Foundation" and from IF-tycoon Thomas Nilefalk.


Liquids Test Laboratory
There is a jar and a bottle here. The bottle contains some wine. There is 
a can here.

The beer can is an OPAQUE LISTED_CONTAINER, so you won't see its contents
unless it's open. Once you open it, it becomes broken, so you can't close
it again.
Neither the can nor the beer inside it have `ex` descriptions.

> ; The can doesn't have an 'ex' attribute!
> ; The can is closed, it should be mentioned:
> x beer can
You can't see what's inside the can, since it's closed.

> ; The beer should be out-of-scope, since the can is closed and OPAQUE:
> x beer
You can't see any beer here.

You can't, since the bottle is closed.
