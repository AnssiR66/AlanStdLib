Alan Library Test Laboratory
Here you are (a dream come true) at the famous top-secret lab where bleeding
edge versions of the StdLib are tested before public release.

This facility is so secretive that only a bunch of high brass in the short chain
of command that links the President to Anssi are in the know of its exact
location. Rumors say it's located somewhere in the Black Forest, whereas others
(with a more consiprative mindset) suggest it's been moved into Area 51, Nevada.

Your invitation as "external counseler" hasn't shred any light on the mistery of
its whereabouts -- you were brought here by helicopter, in the darkest hours of
the night, blindfolded and sedated.

You're presence here is justified only by the task you were asigned, i.e. to
test the out-of-game commands of the libary, and make sure they do what they
were designed to do. So, you better get going, for the clock is ticking...

NORTH of the lab is a restroom.
Hanging high on the wall there is a scoreboard. There is an orange, an avocado, a 
banana, a fig and an apple here. 

/// TICK (turn N° 1) ///

You can turn transcripting on and off using the 'script on/off' command within
the game. The transcript will be available in a file with a name starting with
the game name.

In a GUI version you can also find this in the drop-down menu in the
interpreter. 

In a command line version you can start your game with the '-s' switch to get a 
transcript of the whole game.
