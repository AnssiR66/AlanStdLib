; Actors can be 'compliant' or not, where compliance affects wether items can be
; removed from their inventory or not. The verb `ask_for` is an exception, for
; it temporarily makes the actor compliant to allow extraction of the item, and
; then restores the original compliance state of the actor.

; Test compliance before and after 'ask_for'
; ==============================================================================
; The 'test compliance of' verb debugs the compliance state of an actor.
; (See Issue #18 on the previous 'ask_for' problem).

; Test 'ask_for' with 'liquid'
; ==============================================================================
; The verb `ask_for` is also present on the 'liquid' class, so that asking for
; a liquid which has a vessel behaves as if the player asked for the vessel.
; It should behave just like 'ask_for' in terms of handling actors compliance.
