This luxurious hall is the crossroad to the various clothing departments

fashion temple and back into the world of mortal souls.There is a trashcan 
here. Behind a desk stands the emporium manager. There is your personal
assistant here.

The Dressing Room
The curtains surrounding this room provide you all the privacy you need
to disrobe yourself and try on clothing. There is a chair, a basket, a
pair of dungarees, a skirt, a pair of white pantyhose and a pair of jeans
