This luxurious hall is the crossroad to the various clothing departments
of the emporium. Two large brass doors lead the way south, out of the
fashion temple and back into the world of mortal souls.There is your
personal assistant here.

The Dressing Room
The curtains surrounding this room provide you all the privacy you need
to disrobe yourself and try on clothing. There is a chair, a basket, a
pair of dungarees, a skirt, a pair of white pantyhose and a pair of jeans 
here.

into the room, all the way from the main hall, where you left her.
