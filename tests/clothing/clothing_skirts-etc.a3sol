; This script will test handling of special clothes like skirts and coats in the
; new clothing system, which should allow to implement them like in the old
; system, but with more freedom and added features.
;
; The 'IS NOT blockslegs' attribute allows to create clothing items that don't
; prevent wearing/removing lower garnments that cover only legs (ie. not torso).
; This allows to simulate realistically coats and skirts.
;
; The `IS twopieces` attribute allows creating clothing items which, although
; they do cover both legs and torso, they'll be considered as two-pieces, ie.
; in the wearing/removing checks for 'blockslegs' they'll be treated as if it
; only covered the legs. This allows realistically similuating clohtes like a
; bikini, which is handled as a single item, but being conceptually 2-pieces, it
; should be wearable while wearing a skirt or coat.

; W/ SKIRT -> WEAR/REMOVE-> PANTYHOSE

; A worn skirt should not prevent wearing pantyhose and other lower legs-only
; garnments which don't cover also the torso in a single piece.

; W/ SKIRT -> WEAR/REMOVE-> SWIMSUIT
; ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
; A worn skirt should prevent wearing lower-body garnments which cover both legs
; and torso in a single clothing piece, like a one-piece swimsuit or a teddy.

; A worn skirt should not prevent wearing a bikini because its upper and lower
; piece are disjointed.

; But a bikini shouldn't be wearable if also wearing a torso garnment occupying
; a higher layer (the blocker is not the skirt but the top garnment).
