; The library defines the 'clothing' class as a container, to allow pockets, etc.
; Here we must test how the library handles clothing items inside other clothes,
; and that wearing the latter doesn't affect the former.
; 
; ** NOTE ** ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
;            This test file will become truely useful only after the current
;            initialization problems with nested clothing are solved. It would
;            then be used to do extensive testing on handling nested clothes,
;            like moving them around, have NPCs wear and remove them, etc.
;            Currently this file can't get into any advanced testing.

; Inside the trousers (pocket) we have kippah, which is a wearable item.
examine kippah
DBG kippah
; ** ERROR! ** ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
;              The kippah shouldn't be accounted as being worn, but just carried.
;              The library needs to check at initialize time that only clothes
;              which are DIRECTLY in Hero should be treated as worn items.
