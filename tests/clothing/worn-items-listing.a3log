As you move toward the doors they automagically slide open before you.

Emporium Alani Main Hall
This luxurious hall is the crossroad to the various clothing departments
of the emporium. Two large brass doors lead the way south, out of the
fashion temple and back into the world of mortal souls.There is your
personal assistant here.

> ; Examining NPCs should report worn clothing items.
> examine assistant
She's your personal shopping assistant. The assistant is carrying a pair
of fashion boots (being worn) and a uniform (being worn).

> ; ** NOTE ** Maybe this message should separate what the actor is carrying from
> ;            what he's wearing (like it's done for the Hero).

The Dressing Room
The curtains surrounding this room provide you all the privacy you need
to disrobe yourself and try on clothing. There is a chair, a basket, a
pair of dungarees, a skirt, a pair of white pantyhose and a pair of jeans 
here.

> ; ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
> ; INVENTORY
> ; ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
> ; Taking inventory should report worn clothing items, which are listed separately
> ; from carried items.
> inventory
You are empty-handed. You are wearing your undershirt, your sneakers, your 
khakis, your boxers and your socks.

> ; ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
> ; FAILED WEAR
> ; ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
> ; When the 'wear' verb fails, it reports all the items worn by the Hero:
> wear jeans
You pick up the jeans. You are wearing your undershirt, your sneakers, 
your khakis, your boxers and your socks. Trying to put the jeans on isn't
very sensible.

> ; ** NOTE ** Having 'wear' list all the worn items as an attempt to show to the
> ;            player why the item of the parameter can't be worn is a bit odd,
> ;            for the list could easily become quite long.
> ;            Ideally, the library should be able to do some calculations and
> ;            only mention the item(s) which are preventing the wear action.
> ; ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
> ; FAILED REMOVE
> ; ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
> ; Like with 'wear', when 'remove' fails a list of worn items is printed.
> remove boxers
You are wearing your undershirt, your sneakers, your khakis, your boxers 
and your socks. Trying to take your boxers off isn't very sensible.

> ; ** NOTE ** Unlike 'wear', the message doesn't use the redundant "(being worn)"
> ;            Again, like for 'wear', this message could be improved by reducing
> ;            the listed items to those which are preventing the action.
