; Taking inventory should report worn clothing items, which are listed separately
; from carried items.

; FAILED WEAR
; ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
; When the 'wear' verb fails, it reports all the items worn by the Hero:
wear jeans
; ** NOTE ** Having 'wear' list all the worn items as an attempt to show to the
;            player why the item of the parameter can't be worn is a bit odd,
;            for the list could easily become quite long.
;            Ideally, the library should be able to do some calculations and
;            only mention the item(s) which are preventing the wear action.
; ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
; FAILED REMOVE
; ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
; Like with 'wear', when 'remove' fails a list of worn items is printed.
remove boxers
; ** NOTE ** Unlike 'wear', the message doesn't use the redundant "(being worn)"
;            Again, like for 'wear', this message could be improved by reducing
;            the listed items to those which are preventing the action.
