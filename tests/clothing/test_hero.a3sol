; The hero starts the adventure with some clothing of his own. During the game
; we need to keep track of clothing items belonging to the hero vs items of the
; store for various reasons (eg. when we'll script store clerks to carry the
; hero clothing while he tries on store items, and to pick up and put back store
; items dropped by the hero).
