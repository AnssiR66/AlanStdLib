Author should not locate ROOM/DARK_ROOM and SITE/DARK_SITE instances at
custom locations (e.g. wrapping regions of difference parts of the map)
because these depend on being AT INDOOR/OUTDOOR (respectively) in order
for room/site props to work, and the INDOOR/OUTDOOR locations can't be at
multiple locations at once.

This adventure tests whether ROOM/DARK_ROOM and SITE/DARK_SITE instances
nesting are correctly restored to being AT INDOOR/OUTDOOR (respectively)
after the DEFINITION_BLOCK initialization.
