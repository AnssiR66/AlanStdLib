[[ch.verbs-and-things]]
= Verbs and Things

In ALAN, "`things`" is the comprehensive term for actors and objects.
At the library level, many verbs are defined to work with both actors and objects.
For example, _examine_ works with both.
Then there are various verbs that only work with one of them.
For example, _take_ works with objects only (actors cannot be inside a container, not even in the hero container, so they cannot be taken).
Thus, if you want the hero to be able to take a cat or a bird, you should define them to be objects instead.

Here is a list of transitive verbs that only work with actors:

// 10 items -> 5 columns
[cols="5*<m",width=75%,float=center,frame=none,grid=none,format=csv]
|===============================================================================
ask, ask_for, follow, give, kill, kill_with, say_to, talk, tell, show
|===============================================================================

while these verbs work with objects only:

// 62 items -> 6 columns + 4 empty items
[cols="6*<m",width=90%,float=center,frame=none,grid=none,format=csv]
|===============================================================================
bite, break, break_with, burn, burn_with, buy, clean, climb, climb_on
climb_through, close,close_with, consult, cut, cut_with, dig, dive_in, drink
drive, drop, eat, empty, empty_in, empty_on, examine, exit, extinguish, fill
fill_with, fire, fire_at, fix, get_off, go_to, jump_in, jump_on, knock, lie_in
lie_on, lift, light, lock, lock_with, look_in, look_out_of, look_through, open
open_with, play, pour, pour_in, pour_on, pry, pry_with, put, put_in, put_on
read, remove, remove_from, take, throw, tie, "", "", "", ""
|===============================================================================

The following verbs work with both, but have slightly different outcomes:

// 8 items -> 4 columns
[cols="4*<m",width=75%,float=center,frame=none,grid=none,format=csv]
|===============================================================================
kiss, listen, pull, push, push_with, rub, scratch, touch
|===============================================================================

Lastly, there are some verbs that won't work with either:

// 3 items -> 3 columns
[cols="3*<m",width=50%,float=center,frame=none,grid=none,format=csv]
|===============================================================================
answer, say, write
|===============================================================================

as these verbs can only be used with quoted text (i.e. string literals):

[example,role="gametranscript"]
================================================================================
&gt; _answer "green"_ +
&gt; _say "hello"_ +
&gt; _write "The butler looks guilty" in notepad_
================================================================================


Note that none of the library verbs accept locations as direct or indirect objects.
Thus, the following won't work:

[example,role="gametranscript"]
================================================================================
&gt; _examine bedroom_
================================================================================

In order to make something like this work, you should define a separate bedroom object, present in the bedroom location, which can then be examined or manipulated in any other way that might be required:

// @EXTERNALIZE CODE: bedroom_object
[source,alan]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE bedroom_object ISA OBJECT AT bedroom
  NAME bedroom
  DESCRIPTION "" -- an empty description so that the bedroom_object is
                 -- not visible in the bedroom
  VERB examine
    DOES ONLY DESCRIBE bedroom. -- = show the description of the
                                --   bedroom location
  END VERB.
END THE.
