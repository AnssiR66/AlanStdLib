[[ch.restricted-actions]]
= Restricted Actions

.v2.2.0 Status
[WARNING]
=====================================
:Issue113: https://github.com/AnssiR66/AlanStdLib/issues/113[Issue #113^]
This chapter is being updated to mirror the upcoming v2.2.0 release (See {Issue113}).

* [ ] <<sec.restrictions-levels>> is half done; it still needs some practical examples and additional text on how to use the feature.
* [ ] <<sec.actions-attributes>> still needs to be written.
* [ ] The <<sec.restricted-actions-original,original text is kept in a sub-section>>, it needs to be recycled in the new sections and then be deleted.
=====================================

In some situations, during an adventure, you might need to restrict the actions which the player can carry out.
For example, if the hero is tied to a chair he shouldn't be able to carry out any action that involves physical interaction with his surroundings, but he should be able to carry out any sensory-related actions (e.g. looking, listening, etc.), and the player should still be able to perform out-of-game actions like saving or restoring, etc.

The library provides two means to control which actions are available to the player:

[horizontal]
[.big.red]#Restrictions{nbsp}Levels# ::
A range of five restricted actions presets acting on entire groups of verbs.

[.big.red]#Actions{nbsp}Attributes# ::
Each library verb has a same-named boolean attribute counterpart that can be targeted to enable or disable it at any time.


Both methods control which verbs should be enabled or disabled by tweaking their corresponding actions attributes.
The former method is more practical, since it allows to disable or disable entire groups of verbs at once, whereas the latter offers finer granularity, by allowing to target specific verbs.
The two methods are not mutually exclusive, so they can be used in conjunction.

Every library verb has a `CHECK` that will prevent the action if the corresponding action-restriction attribute is disabled on `my_game`.
If the verb is disabled, the action will fail and the `restricted_response OF my_game` message will be printed instead:

[example,role="gametranscript"]
===============================
You can't do that.
===============================

The default message can be changed at any time by re-defining the `restricted_response` attribute on `my_game`.
E.g.:

[source,alan]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Set restricted_response of my_game to "Not now!".
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Here's an example of how the library handles actions restrictions, taken from the actual definition of the `talk_to` verb:

.Excerpt from the `talk_to` verb definition in {lib_verbs}.
[source,alan, role="lib"]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ADD TO EVERY ACTOR
  VERB talk_to
    CHECK my_game CAN talk_to
      ELSE SAY restricted_response OF my_game.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As you can see from the above code excerpt, the `talk_to` verb has a same-named boolean attribute counterpart on the `my_game` instance, which is used by the library to determine whether the action is currently enable or not.
Likewise, every other library verb has a corresponing attribute, bearing the same identifier as the verb, and a similar `CHECK` to block the action if its disabled.

TIP: The action-restriction attributes are defined inside the {lib_verbs_restrictions} module.

Now that you've greasped the general mechanics behind restricted actions, it's time to learn how to use them in your own adventures.



[[sec.restrictions-levels]]
== Restrictions Levels

.v2.2.0 Status
[WARNING]
=====================================
This section is half done, it still needs:

* [ ] Practical examples and transcripts:
** [ ] Include excerpts from `yes-and-no-example.alan`.
* [ ] Further text to document the feature.
** [ ] Try and reuse as much of <<sec.restricted-actions-original,the original text>> as possible.
=====================================


The library provided five _actions-restrictions_ presets, called '`Actions Restrictions Levels`', which are designed to cover the most common use cases in any adventure.
Restrictions levels act on entire groups of similar verbs, thus enabling authors to quickly control which _types_ of actions should be blocked at any given time.

To change the current restriction level, you only need to change the value of the `restricted_level OF my_game` attribute, assigning to it the integer value of the desired restriction level (range 0-5).
E.g.:

[source,alan]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Set restricted_level of my_game to 4. -- block every verb.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The library constantly monitors the value of `restricted_level` via the `check_restriction` EVENT, which will detect if its value has changed since the last turn, and act accordingly.


The restriction levels are incremental in nature: each level restricts an additional group of actions compared to the previous one, along a continuum with levels 0 and 4 at its extremes -- at level 0 all actions are enabled, at level 4 they're all blocked.

Level 5 is a special level created for YES/NO answers.
Only the verbs `yes` and `'no'` can be used at Level 5.
Furthermore, the `restricted_response` message is changed to [.play]#Please answer YES or NO.# for the whole duration of this level, and then restored to its previous value when switching to another level.
This restriction level is not part of the 0-4 continuum described above; it's an independent level of its own kind.

Level 0 is the default restriction level of the library.

The following table summarizes the actions-restrictions outcome of each level:


[[table.restrictions-levels]]
.Actions Restrictions Levels
[%autowidth.stretch,cols="<.^h,<.<a"]
|===============================================================================
| Level{nbsp}0 |
All verbs are enabled, without restrictions.
It's the default restriction level.

| Level{nbsp}1 |
All verbs involving speech and communication are disabled.

Useful for situations in which the hero can't talk, either temporarily (e.g. he's gagged, underwater, in a noisy place, etc.) or permanently (e.g. he's a toddler or an animal).

| Level{nbsp}2 |
All in-game actions are disabled except for mental and sensory acts which don't involve physical interaction with the environment.
Out-of-game actions (gameplay meta verbs) are enabled as usual.

Useful for situations in which the hero is physically constrained (e.g. tied to a chair, paralyzed, etc.) or in a situation in which he mustn't draw any attention.

| Level{nbsp}3 |
Only out-of-game actions are allowed, i.e. gameplay meta verbs like _save_, _restore_, _score_, etc.

Useful for cutscenes, where the story is brought forward by turn-based dialogs or narrative during which the hero is prevented from interacting with the story world; or to create a custom restriction level where only a few selected in-game actions are permitted.

| Level{nbsp}4 |
All verbs are disabled, the player can only traverse exits.

Mostly used to implement situations in which the player is forced to answer a question (e.g. provide a name for the hero, chose its gender, etc.) via a custom defined verb.
In order to force the answer, all other actions should be blocked, including meta verbs.

| Level{nbsp}5 |
The player can only answer YES or NO.

During this level, the `restricted_response` message changes to:

[example,role="gametranscript"]
Please answer YES or NO.

[[sec.restricted-actions-original]]
== {asterisk}{asterisk}{asterisk} ORIGINAL TEXT {asterisk}{asterisk}{asterisk}

.v2.2.0 Status
[WARNING]
=====================================
This section contains the original _Manual_ text.
We should re-use as much of it as possible, including the code examples, which should be externalized to a real adventure.
=====================================

.EDITORS' NOTE
[CAUTION]
=====================================
Beware that some text and examples are incorrect, because they don't mention the problems relating to switching restriction level and enabling/disabling specific verbs in a single turn (See {Issue113}).
=====================================



Usually, when you need to restrict a verb from doing what it usually does (= when you want to change the default outcome as defined by the library), you can use a DOES ONLY statement:

[source,alan]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE book ISA OBJECT IN table
  DESCRIPTION ""

  VERB examine
    DOES ONLY "It's a thick, heavy book with leather covers."
  END VERB.
END THE book.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(Using DOES ONLY here prevents the default examine response "You notice nothing unusual about the book." from being shown.)

or

[source,alan]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE basement ISA ROOM
  DESCRIPTION "..."

  VERB jump
    DOES ONLY "The ceiling is too low here."
  END VERB.
END THE basement.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

// PAGE 69 //

(The DOES ONLY here prevents the default message for jump, "You jump on the spot, to no avail." from being shown.)

// @FIXME: XREF TO PAGE

However, there are certain situations where you might wish to restrict the outcome for several verbs at once.
Let's imagine the hero is tied into a chair and cannot move his arms or legs.
Then, actions like examine, listen or think might still work, but actions like attack, eat and take should not be allowed to work.
For these situations, the library offers a way to restrict several verbs at once.
Look at the list of all library-defined verbs on p. 61-.
Now, there is a library-defined attribute for each and every verb -- CAN [verb].

If you want to disable any action or actions from the start of a game, you can declare for example

[source,alan]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE my_game ISA DEFINITION_BLOCK
  CAN NOT jump.
  CAN NOT dance.
  CAN NOT sing.
END THE my_game.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

and it won't be possible to jump, dance or sing in the game.
The above is a shorter way to disable verbs than

[source,alan]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE my_game ISA DEFINITION_BLOCK
  VERB jump
    DOES ONLY "You can't do that."
  END VERB.

  VERB dance
    DOES ONLY "You can't do that."
  END VERB.

  VERB sing
    DOES ONLY "You can't do that."
  END VERB.
END THE my_game.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A list of all such attributes, corresponding to all implemented library verbs and commands, would start like this:

// @TODO: Check why 'again' is stropped? shouldn't need to be!

[source,alan]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CAN about.
CAN 'again'.
CAN answer.
CAN ask.
CAN ask_for.
CAN attack.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

// PAGE 70 //



Notice how this list corresponds to the list of verbs on pp. 61-65, so it is not repeated fully here.

The outcome message for restricted verbs like the above is defined by the instance.
The default message is "You can't do that." but it can be easily edited:

[source,alan]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE my_game ISA DEFINITION_BLOCK
  HAS restricted_response "That's not possible presently.".
END THE my_game.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

or

[source,alan]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE my_game ISA DEFINITION_BLOCK
  HAS restricted_response "But you're tied up!".
END THE my_game.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

and so on.
Now, let's again think about the situation where the hero is tied into a chair and cannot move.
This kind of situation requires disabling a rather large number of verbs: attack, eat, take, drop, throw, put, along with numerous other ones.
One could do it like this:


[source,alan]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
EVENT tied_up
  "Suddenly you're interrupted. A couple of crooks enter the room,
   grab hold of you, push you into a chair, gag you and tie you
   into it tightly. You cannot move your arms or legs."
  MAKE my_game NOT attack.
  MAKE my_game NOT attack_with.
  MAKE my_game NOT bite.
  MAKE my_game NOT break.
  MAKE my_game NOT burn.
  MAKE my_game NOT burn_with.
  ...
END EVENT.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

but we quickly understand that such a list would grow very long.
That's why the library offers the option of disabling groups of verbs at once, through a specific attribute of the my_game instance: HAS restricted_level, which by default is 0.
Thus the following coding would actually be unnecessary, but it is included here anyway to show the needed formulation for this attribute:

// PAGE 71 //



[source,alan]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE my_game ISA DEFINITION_BLOCK
  HAS restricted_level 0.
END THE my_game.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To change the level of restriction, do for example like this:

[source,alan]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SET restricted_level OF my_game TO 2.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

=== {asterisk}{asterisk} Restriction Levels {asterisk}{asterisk}

The values of this attributes work in the following way:

a. `HAS restricted_level 0.`
+
This is the default value and it means that no verbs at all are restricted.
Everything works in the normal way.

b. `HAS restricted_level 1.`
+
This restriction can be used when the hero of the game is for example gagged, or the hero is an animal or other instance that cannot talk.
+
_Disabled actions_: `answer`, `ask`, `ask_for`, `say`, `say_to`, `shout`, `sing`, `tell`.
+
Please note that the verb sing is disabled in this group, as well.
Note also that communication verbs are automatically disabled when the restricted_level is 2, as well.

c. `HAS restricted_level 2.`
+
Here, verbs requiring physical action are disabled.
This would be the choice to take when you want to disable verbs when the hero is for example tied up into a chair, or under scrutiny, or in a situation where it would be awkward to try anything drawing attention, like when listening to a lecture, or hiding.
All action verbs, like attack, take, drop, eat, throw, put, etc. are disabled.
All communication verbs, like ask, say and tell are disabled, as well.
Sensory verbs and "passive" action verbs like look, examine, smell, listen, think and wait work.
+
_Allowed actions_: `about`, `again`, `credits`, `examine`, `hint`, `inventory`, `listen0`, `listen`, `look`, `look_at`, `look_behind`, `look_in`, `look_out_of`, `look_through`, `look_under`, `look_up`, `no`, `notify`, `notify_off`, `notify_on`, `pray`, `quit`, `restart`, `restore`, `save`, `score`, `script`, `script_off`, `script_on`, `smell0`, `smell`, `think`, `think_about`, `wait`, `what_am_i`, `what_is`, `where_am_i`, `where_is`, `who_am_i`, `who_is`, `yes`.
+
If you anyway want an individual action verb to work additionally, you can for example do like this:
+
[source,alan]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
EVENT tied_up
  "Suddenly your investigations are interrupted.
   A couple of crooks enter the room, grab hold of you, push
   you sitting on a chair and tie you into it tightly.
   You cannot move your arms or legs."
  SET restricted_level OF my_game TO 2. -- all action verbs will be disabled
  MAKE my_game rub.                     -- but 'rub' will work
END EVENT.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
+
Then, you can for example examine, look, listen, wait etc. but also [.play]#&gt; _rub the strings together_# to make them loosen and open.
+
If you wish to enable communication verbs while you're tied up, you'll have to enable them individually with the "CAN [verb]" method.

d. `HAS restricted_level 3.`
+
Here, even the sensory verbs and "passive" action verbs allowed at the previous level are disabled, besides all physical action verbs.
In fact, all in-game verbs are disabled.
You can't even look or examine.
You can use this restriction level when you want to for example ignore what the player typed and bring the story forward nevertheless.
Only meta verbs like save, quit, restore and about work.
+
_Allowed actions_: `about`, `again`, `credits`, `hint`, `no`, `notify`, `notify_off`, `notify_on`, `quit`, `restart`, `restore`, `save`, `score`, `script`, `script_off`, `script_on`, `yes`.
+
Let's say that you might wish to make a game where only the look, examine and use verbs work.
+
Then, you should code
+
[source,alan]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE my_game ISA DEFINITION_BLOCK
  HAS restricted_level 3.
  CAN 'look'.
  CAN examine.
  CAN 'use'.
  CAN use_with.
END THE.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

e. `HAS restricted_level 4.`
+
At this level, all possible verbs, even meta verbs like save, quit, restore and about are disabled.
It is not usually recommended to use this strict disabling of verbs, but this option is nevertheless offered for some special circumstances. (And you can always allow a verb or two with the CAN [verb] attribute.)
+
_Allowed actions_: none.
+
This level of restriction comes in handy mostly in situations where you want to the game to ask the player about something that has only limited alternative replies, for example
+
[example,role="gametranscript"]
================================================================================
Do you want to restore a saved game (yes/no?)
&gt;
================================================================================
+
To only allow yes and no to work above, do like this:
(Let's imagine the question above is presented at the start of the game, before anything else happens.)
+
[source,alan]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE my_game ISA DEFINITION_BLOCK
  HAS restricted_level 4. -- all possible verbs disabled
  CAN yes. CAN 'no'.      -- but 'yes' and 'no' work
  HAS restricted_response "Please answer 'yes' or 'no'."
END THE.

THE restore_room ISA LOCATION
  NAME -- no name defined for this room
  DESCRIPTION "Do you want to restore a saved game (yes/no?)"

  VERB yes
    DOES ONLY
      SET restricted_level OF my_game TO 0.
      RESTORE.
  END VERB.

  VERB 'no'
    DOES ONLY
      SET restricted_level OF my_game TO 0.
      LOCATE hero AT room1.
  END VERB.
END THE.

THE room1 ISA LOCATION
  DESCRIPTION "This is the first room of the game."
END THE.

START AT restore_room.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
+
Let's say for example that you want to implement the Loud Room from Zork 1.
There, anything you type is repeated:
+
[example,role="gametranscript"]
================================================================================
&gt; _x me_ +
x x...

&gt; _take key_ +
take take...

&gt; _help_ +
help help...

&gt; _quit_ +
quit quit...
================================================================================
+
You can achieve this by implementing
+
[source,alan]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE loud_room ISA ROOM
  ENTERED
    SET restricted_level OF my_game TO 4.
    SET restricted_message OF my_game TO "\$v \$v...".
END THE.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
+
There are a couple of important things to remember with this restriction level.
Firstly, the exits (north, east, etc.) can not be disabled through these attributes.
You must edit the exit messages manually for each situation or location where you restrict the allowed actions.
+
[source,alan]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE loud_room ISA ROOM
  IS loud.
  EXIT east TO corridor
    CHECK loud_room IS NOT loud
      ELSE "east east..."
  END EXIT.
END THE.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
+
Secondly, runtime messages are triggered in the normal way (for example "You can't see any such thing.") and if you want to also disable them in one way or another, you have to edit the messages in the lib_messages file.
For example, to achieve the Loud Room effect above:
+
[source,alan]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MESSAGE NO_SUCH:
  IF restricted_level OF my_game = 3
    THEN "\$v \$v..."
    ELSE "You can't see any such thing."
END IF.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
+
and the same applies to all other messages that might come into question.
+
NOTE: If you conjure up any verbs of your own and wish to disable them at some point in the game, you should add a corresponding attribute to the my_game instance and make it negative at the appropriate point.
Here is an example with the verb 'drive' which is not included in the library by default:
+
[source,alan]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE my_game ISA DEFINITION_BLOCK
  CAN drive.
END THE.

EVENT tied_up
  "One of the thugs ties you tightly into a chair,
   and you cannot move your arms or legs at all."
  SET restricted_level OF my_game TO 2.
  MAKE my_game NOT drive. -- 'drive' being a verb you have defined
END EVENT.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
+
You should also remember to make any self-implemented verb to work again after the restriction doesn't apply any longer.
+
If you have defined a lot of verbs of your own in a game, you can do like this:
+
First, declare the "CAN [verb]" attributes for your own verbs:
+
[source,alan]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE my_game ISA DEFINITION_BLOCK
  CAN drive.
  CAN recall.
  CAN ride.
  CAN type.
END THE.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
+
Then, define when they will be restricted:
+
[source,alan]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WHEN restricted_level OF my_game > 1
  -- three of the above are action verbs, so we restrict them
  -- when the restricted_level is 2 or higher
  THEN
    MAKE my_game NOT drive.
    MAKE my_game NOT ride.
    MAKE my_game NOT type.

WHEN restricted_level OF my_game > 2
  THEN
    MAKE my_game NOT recall.
    -- recall is similar to examine, think, listen, etc.
    -- so we'll cancel it together with those verbs
    -- only (level 3 and higher)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
+
To make these verbs work again, define:
+
[source,alan]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MAKE my_game drive.
MAKE my_game recall.
MAKE my_game ride.
MAKE my_game type.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
+
etc.
