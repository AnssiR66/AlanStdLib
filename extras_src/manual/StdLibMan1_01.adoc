= Importing the Library

[big]#_How to import the Standard Library into your ALAN adenture games_#

.EDITORS' NOTE
[CAUTION]
=====================================
This section needs to be revised entirely; righ now it's just a collection of left-over paragraphs from the original split-up text.

Among the topics that need to be expanded upon, there are:

* [ ] Explain how to keep the library files into their `StdLib/` folder and make them accassible to the adventure via ALAN compiler options.

But the above list is far from complete.
=====================================


When you import the library, there are a couple of extra things you need to add to the code:

[source,alan]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
IMPORT 'library.i'.

THE my_game ISA DEFINITION_BLOCK
END THE my_game.

THE meadow ISA LOCATION
END THE meadow.

START AT meadow.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

// @FIXME: XREF TO PAGE

The `my_game` is an obligatory instance that you need to declare in any adventure that uses the Standard Library.
It will be described in more detail on p.78.


The `IMPORT` statement imports the main library module into the game code, which in turn imports all the other library modules using `IMPORT` statements.


Now, when you run the game, you will find yourself at the meadow location, but you can look, wait, examine yourself, take inventory, try to go in a direction, think, listen, smell, type 'help' for assistance, and many other things.

All the mandatory library files mentioned in <<sec.mandatory-resources>> should be in the same folder as your source code file.


.EDITORS' NOTE (@tajmone)
[CAUTION]
=====================================
Is the paragraph below _really_ needed? If an author has lost the main `library.i` module, he/she probably should download the whole package again, because only G{asterisk}d knows what other integrity problems might be lurkning in the dark, when dealing with such a chaotic regime of assets organization!

After all, it's not as if end users are charged for downloading the StdLib package -- it's free as in _free coffee, beer and crauts_!

If this paragraph is to be kept, I suggest we should ask the mindless user who has lost the **main library module** to chop-off a finger with an axe (Yakuza style), out of respect for all the sweat, tears and blood shed by the StdLib maintainers in the course of time -- of course, that' just my humble opinion, dictated at the peak of frustration for the upcoming mid-Nov. ETA which is getting closer and closer!
=====================================


If you don't have `library.i` in the same folder as the obligatory library files, you should import the obligatory library files in the following way (which is somewhat lengthier):


[source,alan]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
IMPORT 'lib_actors.i'.
IMPORT 'lib_classes.i'.
IMPORT 'lib_clothing.i'.
IMPORT 'lib_definitions.i'.
IMPORT 'lib_liquid.i'.
IMPORT 'lib_locations.i'.
IMPORT 'lib_messages_library.i'.
IMPORT 'lib_messages_runtime.i'.
IMPORT 'lib_verbs.i'.
IMPORT 'lib_verbs_restrictions.i'.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



// @REMOVED: ALAN IDE Screenshot and comments!
//    The screenshot no longer mirrored the current library modules.
//    The text also mentioned some old DLLs which are no longer part of the
//    ALAN interpreter. We're keeping the original text commented out, in case
//    we decide to create a new screenshot and update the text.

////
Here is a screenshot of what a typical ALAN project folder might look like:

image::img_folders.jpg[]

Notes to the above image:

Notice the five obligatory library files (all starting with `lib_...`), together with the file `library.i` that imports them to a game project.
In addition, there are two DLL files that are automatically installed to where you install the ALAN interpreter.
If you copy the interpreter program to another folder, you should also copy these two DLL files.
The compiler and the interpreter in this example are the Windows executables winalan.exe and winarun.exe, respectively.
In this example, an author has started writing a new game called Treasure Hunt, and `treasurehunt.alan` is the source file (a normal text file containing the ALAN code) while `treasurehunt.a3c` is the compiled game.
An IFID file is created automatically when you compile an ALAN game.
IFID stands for Interactive Fiction IDentifier.
An IFID is a serial number that's assigned to each work of Interactive Fiction.
Each work has its own unique IFID, giving players, authors, and archivists a universal, unambiguous way to refer to a given game.
It's the same idea as the ISBN system for books.
The IFID system is defined by the Treaty of Babel which was created in 2006.
