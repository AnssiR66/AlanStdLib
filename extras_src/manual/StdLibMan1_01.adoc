= Importing the Library

[big]_How to import the Standard Library into your ALAN adenture games_#


When you import the library, there are a couple of extra things you need to add to the code:

[source,alan]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
IMPORT 'library.i'.

THE my_game ISA DEFINITION_BLOCK
END THE my_game.

THE meadow ISA LOCATION
END THE meadow.

START AT meadow.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now, when you run the game, you will find yourself at the meadow location, but you can look, wait, examine yourself, take inventory, try to go in a direction, think, listen, smell, type 'help' for assistance, and many other things.


The IMPORT statement imports the library files into the game code.
The five obligatory library files mentioned on p.1, together with the file 'library.i' that imports them, should be in the same folder as your source code file.


If you don't have `library.i` in the same folder as the obligatory library files, you should import the obligatory library files in the following way (which is somewhat lengthier):


[source,alan]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
IMPORT 'lib_actors.i'.
IMPORT 'lib_classes.i'.
IMPORT 'lib_clothing.i'.
IMPORT 'lib_definitions.i'.
IMPORT 'lib_liquid.i'.
IMPORT 'lib_locations.i'.
IMPORT 'lib_messages_library.i'.
IMPORT 'lib_messages_runtime.i'.
IMPORT 'lib_verbs.i'.
IMPORT 'lib_verbs_restrictions.i'.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

// @FIXME: XREF TO PAGE

`my_game` is an obligatory instance that you have to include in your game source file when using the library.
It will be described in more detail on p.78.

Here is a screenshot of what a typical ALAN project folder might look like:

Notes to the above image:

Notice the five obligatory library files (all starting with `lib_...`), together with the file `library.i` that imports them to a game project.
In addition, there are two DLL files that are automatically installed to where you install the ALAN interpreter.
If you copy the interpreter program to another folder, you should also copy these two DLL files.
The compiler and the interpreter in this example are the Windows executables winalan.exe and winarun.exe, respectively.
In this example, an author has started writing a new game called Treasure Hunt, and `treasurehunt.alan` is the source file (a normal text file containing the ALAN code) while `treasurehunt.a3c` is the compiled game.
An IFID file is created automatically when you compile an ALAN game.
IFID stands for Interactive Fiction IDentifier.
An IFID is a serial number that's assigned to each work of Interactive Fiction.
Each work has its own unique IFID, giving players, authors, and archivists a universal, unambiguous way to refer to a given game.
It's the same idea as the ISBN system for books.
The IFID system is defined by the Treaty of Babel which was created in 2006.
