= Introduction


.v2.2.0 Status
[WARNING]
==========================
*TBD!* We need to write a general introduction on attributes defined by the library, and how these empower authors to quickly create complex objects without having to use classes.

This introductory text should precede the chapters presenting the specific attributes, for it serves as a primer for StdLib newbies who have never worked before with library attributes like `scenery`, `readable`, etc.
