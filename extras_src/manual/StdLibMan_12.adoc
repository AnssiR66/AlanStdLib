[[ch12]]
= Runtime messages

Many of the runtime messages built into ALAN have been altered in the library from their default wording as stated in the ALAN manual.
This is to ensure that plural is handled correctly and that there are no clashes between first and second person.
The first person of some default wordings (for example "`I don't know the word $1`") is changed to a more passive or impersonal formulation.
To edit these for your game, open `lib_messages.i` and edit the wanted message(s) there.
