# Directory Contents

+ [`/haml/`][haml] — customized Haml templates.
+ [`docinfo.html`][docinfo] — commonly shared docinfo file (autogenerated).
+ [`highlight-treeprocessor_mod.rb`][rb] — extension for Highlight integration.

## The Docinfo File

The docinfo file is shared by all documents:

- [`adoc/docinfo.html`][docinfo]

The conversion toolchain is set to use this docinfo file for all converted documents, via CLI-defined attribute:

```basgh
asciidoctor \
  -a docinfodir@=$adocDir \
  -a docinfo@=shared-head \
```

As you can see, the `@` [precedence modifier][ADoc §10.2.1] was used in order to lower the CLI priority and allow ovverriding these docinfo attributes from within the document, if needed:

```asciidoc
:docinfodir: <whatever>
:docinfo: <whatever>
```


The docinfo file contains the custom CSS for styling Alan code and other custom elements of the documentation. To keep all documents fully standalone, the Sass generated CSS is automatically injected into the document `<head>` section by the following script:

- [`../sass/docinfo-inject.sh`][docinfo-inject.sh]

For more details on docinfo files, see:

- [Asciidcotor User Manual: _§49. Docinfo Files_][ADoc §49]
