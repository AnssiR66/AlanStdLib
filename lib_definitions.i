-- General attributes
-- ==================

-- We define general attributes for every thing ( = object or actor):


ADD TO EVERY THING

  IS examinable.
    -- the library declares SOUNDs as not examinable.
     inanimate.
    -- actors are NOT inanimate.
     movable.
    -- to allow pushing, pulling, lifting, etc.
     open.
    -- = not closed.
     reachable.
    -- See also 'distant' below
     takeable.
    -- you'll have to separately define which objects are NOT takeable.
    -- By default, the floor, walls, ceiling, ground and sky objects
    -- are not takeable. The same goes for all doors, windows, sounds, liquids
    -- that are not in containers, and actors.

  HAS allowed {null_object}.
    -- container objects only take what is allowed for them to take;
    -- this applies to verbs empty_in, pour_in, put_in and throw_in.
    -- "null_object" is a default dummy that can be ignored.

  HAS ex "".            -- an alternative way of giving responses to >x [thing],
          -- instead of 'VERB examine DOES ONLY..."
          -- See the library manual for more info.

  HAS matching_key null_key.
    -- All lockable doors need a matching key to lock/unlock them.
    -- "null_key" is a default dummy that can be ignored. This attribute
    -- is here added to every thing instead of just doors, to enable
    -- matching keys to be programmed for other locked objects, too, like for
    -- example treasure chests etc.

  HAS text "".

  NOT broken.
  NOT distant.
    -- Usage: you can for example talk to a "not reachable" actor but not to a "distant" one.
    -- You can also throw things in, to or at a not reachable target but not to a distant one.
    -- Default response for not reachable things: "The [thing] is out of your reach."
    -- Default response for distant things: "The [thing] is too far away."
  NOT drinkable.
  NOT edible.
  NOT fireable.
    -- can (not) be used as a firearm
  NOT lockable.
  NOT locked.
  NOT 'on'.
  NOT openable.
  NOT readable.
  NOT scenery.
    -- scenery has special responses for 'examine' and 'take', behaves like a normal object otherwise.
  NOT wearable.
  NOT writeable.

  CAN NOT talk.




-- We still define that plural nouns are preceded by "some" (and not by "a" or "an"):

INDEFINITE ARTICLE

  IF THIS IS NOT plural
    THEN "a"
    ELSE "some"
  END IF.

END ADD TO.



-- If you need "an", you should declare it separately at the instance, for example:

-- THE owl ISA ACTOR
--    AT woods
--    INDEFINITE ARTICLE "an"
-- END THE.


-- (We add the 'plural' attribute to the 'entity' class, because the plural
-- applies not only to things but also to for example parameters in syntax statements; ignore.)


ADD TO EVERY ENTITY
  IS NOT plural.
END ADD TO.



-- Some null defaults defined that have been mentioned above:


THE null_object ISA OBJECT
END THE.


THE null_key ISA OBJECT
END THE.



-- Some weight attributes for things:


ADD TO EVERY THING
  HAS weight 0.
END ADD TO THING.


ADD TO EVERY ACTOR
  HAS weight 50.
END ADD TO ACTOR.


ADD TO EVERY OBJECT
  HAS weight 5.
END ADD TO OBJECT.


-- These attributes are mostly used to check if something is movable.



-- An attribute for keeping track of nested locations; used internally in the library (ignore).

ADD TO EVERY LOCATION
  HAS nested {nowhere}.
END ADD TO.




-- Common synonyms
-- ===============


-- Next, we declare synonyms for some common words so that it will be possible
-- for the player to type commands such as both "put ball in box" and
-- "put ball into box", etc:


SYNONYMS

into, inside = 'in'.
onto = on.
thru = through.
using = 'with'.


-- Here are some synonyms for the player character:

me, myself, yourself, self = hero.




-- Attributes for the my_game definition block
-- ===========================================

-- Here, we create a class, "definition_block", to group various definitions under.
-- In the game source file, the author should declare an instance 'my_game' which belongs
-- to this class.



EVERY definition_block ISA LOCATION


  -- attributes for the start section (banner):
  -- ==========================================

  HAS title "My New Game".
      HAS subtitle "".
      HAS author "An ALAN Author".
      HAS year 2017.
      HAS version "1".

  -- These will be shown at the start of the game if you add
    -- DESCRIBE banner.
  -- after START AT [location].



  -- messages for the hero:
  -- ======================

  -- The hero is not defined as an instance in the library; the game author
  -- has all the freedom to define the hero as they see fit. However,
  -- there are some messages for the hero defined in the library. These can be
  -- easily overridden. Two of these messages are right here, the rest are
  -- for example in verb checks.

  HAS hero_worn_header "You are wearing".
  HAS hero_worn_else "You are not wearing anything.".


  -- description messages for dark locations:
  -- ========================================

  HAS dark_loc_desc "It is pitch black. You can't see anything at all.".
    -- This message is shown when the player tries to LOOK or do actions requiring light
    -- in a dark location.

  HAS light_goes_off "It is now pitch black.".
    -- This message is shown when a light goes off and the location becomes dark.


  -- response for restricted actions:
  -- ================================

  HAS restricted_response "You can't do that.".
    -- This message is shown whenever the player used a verb that has been restricted
     -- by the "CAN NOT [verb]" attributes further down this file.

  HAS restricted_level 0.           -- 0 = no verbs are restricted
  HAS previous_restricted_level 0.  -- used to detect changes in restrcition level.





  -- all illegal parameter messages, typically found in the ELSE parts of SYNTAX structures and
  -- the first two below being by far the most common.
