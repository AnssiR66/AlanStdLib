; We'll be stress-testing unlit locations vs DARK_LOCATION instances, to ensure
; they both behave as expected when faced with the presence and absence of light
; sources, when they change state from lit to unlit (and vice-versa), and when
; actors enter and leave them (with and without light sources).
; ==============================================================================
; LOCATION (NOT LIT)
; ==============================================================================
; The kitchen is a normal location, therefore it should not be affected by the
; presence of light sources, nor it should execute a LOOK when it becomes lit,
; or print the 'light_goes_off' message when it becomes dark.

; The hero's torch should have NO EFFECT here:

; Let's summon and dismiss Lumen, who carries a lit candle (again, NO EFFECT):
