= Working With Classes

As we have already seen, it is possible to use classes and subclasses in various contexts in ALAN.
The library defines a large number of subclasses for actors and objects and locations, as seen in the previous chapters.

You can define or edit a class-specific attribute in three ways.

a. You can give an attribute to a class of your own:
+
[source,alan]
------------------------
EVERY jewelry ISA OBJECT
  IS expensive.
END EVERY.
------------------------

b. You can add an attribute of your own to a predefined class:
+
Use the ADD TO command to add new attributes for predefined classes.
+
[source,alan]
-------------------
ADD TO EVERY WINDOW
  IS NOT cleaned.
END ADD.
-------------------

c. Changing the attribute of a predefined class.
+
Use INITIALIZE in the `my_game` instance.
Here, the game author wants (for some reason) to make all CLOTHING objects not wearable:
+
[source,alan]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE my_game ISA DEFINITION_BLOCK
  INITIALIZE
    FOR EACH c ISA CLOTHING DO
      MAKE c NOT wearable.
    END FOR.
END THE my_game.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
+
Here, you wouldn't be able to use `ADD TO`, as you cannot add an attribute that has been already defined for a class, even if you change it to its opposite (for example `wearable <> NOT wearable`).



== Overriding library responses for classes

If you wish to override the library response to a verb within a specific class, use DOES ONLY with the verb:

[source,alan]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
EVERY cat ISA ACTOR
  VERB examine
    DOES ONLY "It's just an ordinary cat."
  END VERB.
END EVERY.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

// PAGE 59 //



This will override the default library message for examine for all CATs in the game.

However, if you wish to change the verb outcome for a class predefined in the library, you should do like below.
Here, the verb outcome for examine has been modified for all WINDOWs in the game:

[source,alan]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE my_game ISA DEFINITION_BLOCK
  VERB examine
    CHECK obj <> window
     ELSE "It's rectangular and transparent, like a window usually is."
  END VERB.
END THE.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you wish to add a verb check for a specific class:

[source,alan]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ADD TO EVERY cat
  VERB catch
    CHECK nails OF THIS ARE cut
      ELSE "You might just get scratched."
  END VERB.
END ADD.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note that there is no DOES/DOES ONLY section here; the check is performed on the cat class only, and if the check is passed, the library outcome of the take verb will be carried out.
