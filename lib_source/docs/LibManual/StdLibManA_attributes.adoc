[appendix]
[[app.default-attributes]]
= Default Library Attributes

.EDITORS' NOTE
[CAUTION]
=====================================
*TBD!* This Appendix will present all the library-defined attributes in a well formatted table, where we could have a column describing how the library uses each attribute, and another mentioning potential uses for the author (all of it with nice cross-reference links, etc.).

It replaces the old "`Default Library Attributes`" chapter, that was deleted from
Part "`Getting Started`".

See {Issue114} for a discussion on library attributes in the _StdLib Manual_, and the proposal to dump this chapter.
