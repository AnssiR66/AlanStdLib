# System Requirements

To build the CSS stylesheets you'll need to install [Sass] on your machine:

- [Ruby] + [Ruby Sass]

or:

- [Node.js] + [Dart Sass]

Sass is migrating from Ruby to Node.js, but for the purpose of this project either version should be fine (I'm still using the Ruby version), so just install the version that is more practical to you (since in this project you'll need Ruby also for Asciidoctor, you might use Sass Ruby if you don't have Node.js on your system).

## Node.js + Sass

### Installing Node.js on Windows

Download the installer from [Node.js] website.

Alternatively, you can install the [Chocolatey Node.js package][Choco Node] (also available in [LTS version][Choco Node LTS]) via [Chocolatey] or [Chocolatey GUI].

### Dart Sass

Once [Node.js] is installed on your system, open a shell and type:

    npm install -g sass

Alternatively, you can install the [Sass Chocolatey package][Choco Sass] via [Chocolatey] or [Chocolatey GUI].


## Ruby + Sass

### Installing Ruby on Windows

If you're using Windows, you should install Ruby via [RubyInstaller], which is also available as a [Chocolatey package][Choco Ruby] (see [Chocolatey] and [Chocolatey GUI]).

### Ruby Sass

Once Ruby is installed on your system, open a shell and type:

    gem install sass
